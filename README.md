# What the Dub?! - Forsen pack
This is a pack of clips taken from [Sebastian "RolePlayer" Fors (Forsen)](twitch.tv/forsen) to be used in the game called [What the Dub?!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1495860/What_The_Dub/)

## How to install
1. [Download](https://github.com/g7eternal/wtd-forsen-pack/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repository to get all the clips and prompts. Unpack the archive.
2. In Steam library select your *What the Dub?!* game, right-click to get into *Properties*, then *Local Files*. Then press *Browse* to see the game's files.
3. Navigate to the following folder: _WhatTheDub_Data\StreamingAssets_
4. Rename or remove the following folders:
    - UiVideo
    - TheEndClips
5. **If you do NOT want to use original clips** (instead you want to use the Forsen's prompts exclusively), rename/remove the following folders as well:
    - Subtitles
    - VideoClips
6. Copy all the folders from the unpacked archive into _StreamingAssets_.
7. All done! Start up the game to confirm: installation has been successful if intro is changed.

## Technical info
Info on how the game works was taken from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAndChill/comments/mtacw3/lets_make_new_what_the_dub_vids_peepopog/).
- Basically you need some MP4 clips in _VideoClips_ folder, and SRT subtitles in _Subtitles_ folder for this to work. The name of MP4 should match with the name of SRT.
- _UiVideo_ folder contains all the intro/intermission/outro clips, simply replace them with any video of your choice.
- At the end of the game a random clip from _TheEndClips_ is chosen and played for the users. Add as many as you like.
